# BlogApp

Hey, Its my very first simple blog app, where you can create, read, update and delete blogs.
The app starts at a login page, where you need to enter email and password. 
The email and password are : "abc@gmail.com" and "123456"
In the home page we can see all the blogs and to see them in detail click on the title or any detail of the blog post.
You can update and delete in the same home page.

Thanks for using.
